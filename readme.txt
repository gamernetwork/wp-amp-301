A plugin that integrates AMP with Simple 301 Redirects

== Description ==

**AMP 301** is a simple plugin that applies the functionality of <a href="https://en-gb.wordpress.org/plugins/simple-301-redirects/">Simple 301 Redirects</a> to AMP (<a href="https://www.ampproject.org/">Accelerated Mobile Pages</a>) articles.

No configuration required, this plugin will automatically apply redirects to AMP pages as defined by the Simple 301 Redirects plugin. For instance, if `/2016/01/01/an-old-page` is supposed to redirect to `/2016/02/01/a-new-page`, then `/2016/01/01/an-old-page/amp` will redirect to `/2016/02/01/a-new-page/amp`.
